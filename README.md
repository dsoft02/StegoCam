# StegoCam App

StegoCam is an Android application that allows users to hide and extract secret messages within images using steganography techniques. With StegoCam, you can securely embed confidential information within images and share them with others while maintaining the visual integrity of the images.

## Features

The StegoCam app consists of the following modules:

1. Splash Screen: Upon launching the app, a visually appealing splash screen welcomes the users and provides a seamless transition into the application.

2. PIN Setup: Users can set up a personal identification number (PIN) to secure their StegoCam app. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the app and perform sensitive operations.

3. Login: After setting up the PIN, users can log in to the app using their PIN. StegoCam incorporates a secure login mechanism to protect user data and maintain privacy.

4. Main Menu: The main menu serves as the central hub for accessing various features of the app. From the main menu, users can navigate to different modules and perform desired actions.

5. Embed: In the Embed module, users can select an image from their device's gallery and enter a secret message to be hidden within the image using steganography techniques. StegoCam employs advanced algorithms to ensure seamless integration of the message while preserving the image's visual appearance.

6. Extract: The Extract module allows users to extract hidden messages from images. By selecting an image that contains a hidden message, users can retrieve the embedded information effortlessly.

7. Stego History: StegoCam maintains a history of all the images that have been used for embedding or extraction. This feature enables users to track their previous steganography activities and review the images they have processed.

8. Settings: The Settings module provides users with options to customize their StegoCam experience. Users can change their PIN, update their security question, and enable or disable fingerprint login for added convenience and security.

9. About: The About section provides general information about the StegoCam app, including the version, developer details, and acknowledgments.
